This quiz is already hard from Level 1 if you don't read this instruction
## Solving Guide & Bonus Info
From levels 1 to 5, there are 3 messages per level. Level 6 has one message only.

The messages will look something like this example:

oytru dcnanscma eat mdfsufhs forfoms mcofro fmewhalin g

This isn't just some gibberish, it's an *actual* message. Here's how:

**oy**-tr-**u** d-**c**-n-**an**-scma **eat** ...

*Pay attention to letters in bold. You'll realize there are letters scrambled throughout some "words". Combine those letters to create an actual word*

For this example, combine all the bold letters and you get: OYUCANEAT...

*Wait, what is Oyu?*

You may have to reorder the letters too! Oyu --> You.

So it's: YOUCANEAT...

Can you decode the rest of the example?

But we're just getting started... If you can decode all messages from all 6 levels, you get a prize. (more info in the wiki)

**BONUS TIP:** Sometimes, you'll find some weird words, for example: you've stumbled accross this *mag net*, what do you do? You'll need to "merge" them into an actual word. In this example, *mag net* turns to *magnet*

There are also tips throughout each level, I'm not gonna bother listing them here
