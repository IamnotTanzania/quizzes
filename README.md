A challenge waiting for you
## How it works
You'll see a bunch of message that looks like this:

oytru dcnanscma eat mdfsufhs forfoms mcofro fmewhalin g

This isn't just some gibberish, it's an *actual* message. Here's how:

**oy**-tr-**u** d-**c**-n-**an**-scma **eat** ...

*Look for letter combos!*

Combine them and you get: OYUCANEAT...

*Wait, what is Oyu?*

You sometime have to reorder the letters too! Oyu --> You.

So it's: YOUCANEAT...

Can you decode the rest of the example?

But we're just getting started... If you can decode all messages from all 6 levels, you get bucks. (more info after you solved all messages).

**BONUS TIP:** Sometimes, you'll find something like MAG NET when you solve the puzzle. You'll need to "merge" them.
